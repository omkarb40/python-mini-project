## Game Flow

### Welcome Screen
Each game starts with a decorative welcome screen followed by the game menu.

### Main Menu
From the main menu, you can:
- Choose to play **Rock Paper Scissors** or **Cows and Bulls**.
- Exit the program.

### Rock Paper Scissors Menu
- Choose to start the game or read the rules.
- Score 3 points before the computer to win.

### Cows and Bulls Menu
- Guess the 4-letter secret word.
- Get feedback in the form of **Cows** (correct letters in wrong position) and **Bulls** (correct letters in correct position).
- Maximum of 15 guesses allowed.

## Dependencies
- This game is built using Python's standard library and requires no external dependencies.
- Python's `random` module is used for generating random choices.

## Known Issues
- The word list for **Cows and Bulls** is currently limited to 10 words. You can easily expand this by editing the `words` array in the code.
- Some parts of the code could benefit from additional input validation (e.g., non-integer inputs for menu choices).

## Future Improvements
- Adding more words to the **Cows and Bulls** word bank.
- Improving input validation for a more robust user experience.
